# Task 1.1a: Verify action.yml Core Configuration Updates

## Objective
Verify that the action.yml core configuration updates were completed correctly and identify any issues or "Claude fraud" (incomplete/incorrect implementations).

## Context
Another agent has updated the action.yml file to convert from gemini-cli to llxprt-code. You must verify the changes are correct and complete.

## File to Review
`/Volumes/XS1000/acoliver/projects/automerge/run-llxprt-code/action.yml`

## Verification Checklist

### 1. Action Metadata Verification
- [ ] `name:` field says "Run LLxprt Code" (not "Run Gemini CLI")
- [ ] `author:` field no longer says "Google LLC"
- [ ] `description:` mentions "LLxprt Code" not "Gemini CLI"
- [ ] URLs in metadata point to correct repository (if any)

### 2. Input Name Verification
- [ ] Input `gemini_cli_version` has been renamed to `llxprt_version`
- [ ] The input still has default value 'latest'
- [ ] Description is appropriate for llxprt
- [ ] No `gemini_cli_version` references remain elsewhere in the file

### 3. Directory Path Verification
Search for and verify ALL occurrences:
- [ ] No `.gemini/` paths remain (should be `.llxprt/`)
- [ ] Check settings directory creation
- [ ] Check telemetry setup paths
- [ ] Check any other directory references

### 4. Command Verification
- [ ] Version check uses `llxprt --version` (not `gemini --version`)
- [ ] Execution command uses `llxprt --yolo --prompt` (not `gemini --yolo --prompt`)
- [ ] Any other gemini command references are updated

### 5. Unchanged Elements Verification
Confirm these were NOT changed (as per task scope):
- [ ] Installation logic (lines 109-137) still references gemini-cli (this is correct for this phase)
- [ ] No new inputs were added (provider, model, api_key should NOT exist yet)
- [ ] GitHub token and telemetry logic unchanged
- [ ] Shell configuration unchanged

### 6. YAML Validity
- [ ] YAML syntax is valid (proper indentation, quotes, etc.)
- [ ] No syntax errors introduced
- [ ] File structure maintained

## Regression Checks

1. Search for any remaining "gemini" references that should have been changed:
   - Use grep to find "gemini" (case-insensitive)
   - Identify which ones should have been changed vs. kept

2. Search for any "Gemini" references (capitalized):
   - Should be changed to "LLxprt" in user-facing text
   - May remain in technical contexts (e.g., GEMINI_API_KEY)

3. Verify backward compatibility:
   - GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable handling should still exist

## Common Issues to Check

1. **Partial Updates**: Did the agent miss any gemini references?
2. **Over-updating**: Did the agent change things that should remain (like GEMINI_API_KEY)?
3. **Formatting Issues**: Did the changes break YAML formatting?
4. **Typos**: Any typos in "llxprt" or "LLxprt"?

## Output

Create a verification report that includes:
1. ✅ or ❌ for each checklist item
2. List of any issues found
3. Specific line numbers where problems exist
4. Recommendation: PASS or FAIL
5. If FAIL, provide specific fixes needed

## Important Notes
- Be thorough - check EVERY occurrence, not just the first one
- Installation logic SHOULD still reference gemini-cli at this phase
- GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable should remain for backward compatibility
- Focus on correctness and completeness of the specified changes only
