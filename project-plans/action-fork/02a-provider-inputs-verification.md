# Task 1.2a: Verify Multi-Provider Inputs Implementation

## Objective
Verify that multi-provider input parameters were correctly added to action.yml and identify any implementation issues.

## Context
Another agent has added provider-related inputs to support multi-provider functionality. You must verify these changes are correct, complete, and maintain backward compatibility.

## File to Review
`/Volumes/XS1000/acoliver/projects/automerge/run-llxprt-code/action.yml`

## Verification Checklist

### 1. New Input Parameters
Verify these inputs exist with correct properties:

#### provider input
- [ ] Exists in inputs section
- [ ] Has description mentioning AI providers
- [ ] required: false
- [ ] default: 'gemini' (CRITICAL for backward compatibility)
- [ ] Lists example providers in description

#### model input
- [ ] Exists in inputs section
- [ ] Has appropriate description
- [ ] required: false
- [ ] NO default value (this is correct)

#### api_key input
- [ ] Exists in inputs section
- [ ] Has description about provider API key
- [ ] required: false
- [ ] NO default value

#### api_key_file input
- [ ] Exists in inputs section
- [ ] Has description about file path
- [ ] required: false
- [ ] NO default value

### 2. Backward Compatibility
- [ ] gemini_api_key input STILL EXISTS
- [ ] gemini_api_key description updated to mention dual use
- [ ] gemini_api_key description mentions ServerTools capability
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing inputs

### 3. Environment Variable Mapping
Verify environment variable setup exists and is correct:
- [ ] LLXPRT_PROVIDER gets set from inputs.provider
- [ ] LLXPRT_MODEL gets set from inputs.model
- [ ] LLXPRT_API_KEY gets set from inputs.api_key
- [ ] LLXPRT_API_KEY_FILE gets set from inputs.api_key_file
- [ ] These are set BEFORE CLI invocation
- [ ] Proper bash conditionals (check for non-empty values)

### 4. Comments and Documentation
- [ ] Comment exists explaining dual-provider mode
- [ ] Comment mentions Gemini for ServerTools capability
- [ ] Comments are clear and helpful

### 5. YAML Structure
- [ ] Proper indentation maintained
- [ ] No syntax errors
- [ ] Inputs are in logical order
- [ ] Formatting consistent with rest of file

## Regression Checks

### 1. Backward Compatibility Test Cases
Verify these scenarios would still work:

**Scenario A: Existing workflow with only gemini_api_key**
```yaml
with:
  gemini_api_key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
```
- [ ] Would default to provider: 'gemini'
- [ ] Would use the gemini_api_key

**Scenario B: New workflow with provider/api_key**
```yaml
with:
  provider: 'anthropic'
  api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```
- [ ] Would use anthropic as provider
- [ ] Would use the provided api_key

**Scenario C: Dual-provider mode**
```yaml
with:
  provider: 'openai'
  api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
  gemini_api_key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
```
- [ ] Would use OpenAI for chat
- [ ] Would have Gemini available for ServerTools

### 2. Edge Cases
Check handling of:
- [ ] Empty provider (should default to 'gemini')
- [ ] Provider without api_key (should be allowed)
- [ ] api_key without provider (should work with default gemini)
- [ ] Both api_key and api_key_file (both should be passed through)

## Common Issues to Check

1. **Missing default**: Provider MUST default to 'gemini'
2. **Wrong environment variable names**: Should use LLXPRT_ prefix
3. **Premature invocation**: Environment vars must be set before CLI runs
4. **Breaking changes**: gemini_api_key must still work
5. **Incorrect conditionals**: Should check for non-empty, not just defined

## Output

Create a verification report that includes:
1. ✅ or ❌ for each checklist item
2. List of any issues found with line numbers
3. Assessment of backward compatibility
4. Recommendation: PASS or FAIL
5. If FAIL, specific fixes needed

## Important Notes
- Provider defaulting to 'gemini' is CRITICAL for backward compatibility
- Model should NOT have a default value
- Environment variable setup timing is important
- Test all three usage scenarios mentally
